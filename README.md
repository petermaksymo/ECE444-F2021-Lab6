### What are the pros and cons of TDD?

As its common for developers to often neglect testing due to time constraints, TDD is great as it forces the developer to have tests in place before they even start to develop their project. TDD also forces your code to be testable and modular from the start, prevents bugs as features must pass tests, and makes refactoring easier. It can also increase the programmer's confidence, both within themselves seeing progress as tests pass, and with their work's integration within the bigger project as tests would catch if their part broke something elsewhere.

However, there are drawbacks for TDD. For instance, it slows down development time, especially at the beginning which increase the time required for the initial product. It is cumbersome so it can be hard to convince your team to follow TDD and learn how to effectively do it. Refactoring in the early stages of development also means that you will need to refactor the tests, taking up even more time.
